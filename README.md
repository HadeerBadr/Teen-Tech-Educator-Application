# 🎓 Oral Exam Simulation

This project is a 3D simulation designed to mimic the environment and flow of oral examinations, offering students a realistic and interactive experience to help reduce anxiety and improve preparedness.

## 🧠 Objective
To simulate the process of oral exams using an interactive 3D environment that replicates exam settings, evaluator interaction, and timing dynamics. This simulation can be used as a practice tool for students and as a demonstration for academic institutions.

## 🎯 Features
- 3D environment representing a typical oral exam room
- Simulated examiner and student interaction
- Countdown timer for questions and responses
- Realistic spatial design and visual/audio feedback

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
- Blender / Unity / Any 3D simulation tool (please replace with the actual one used)
- File format: `.dae` (Collada 3D file format)
- Basic animation and object interaction

## 📁 Files Included
- `3D.dae` — The main 3D simulation file
- `simulation.alp` — (Optional) Associated simulation project file, if used with a specific tool

## 🚀 How to Use
1. Open the `.dae` file in a compatible 3D viewer (e.g., Blender or Unity).
2. Load or configure animations/interactions if available.
3. Simulate to explore or present the exam setup.

## 📌 Use Cases
- Academic demonstration for oral exam structure
- Student training and mock exams
- Educational presentations or workshops
